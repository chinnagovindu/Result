A single crystal of p-toluidine p-toluenesulfonate (PTPT) has been grown by slow evaporation solution technique (SEST) at room temperature. 
Single crystal X-ray analysis confirms that grown crystal belongs to the monoclinic structure with space group P21. 
Intermolecular interactions and fingerprint plots of PTPT molecules are executed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. 
It was found that H···H (44.2%) contacts have maximum intermolecular interactions contributions in the total Hirshfeld surface area. 
The characteristic absorption band occurs at below 290 nm. 
The functional groups were identified using FTIR and FT-Raman analyses and compared with theoretical values. 
The title molecule contains fourteen Csingle bondH bonds and three Osingle bondH bonds.
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy values are −6.125 eV and −1.157 eV, respectively.
